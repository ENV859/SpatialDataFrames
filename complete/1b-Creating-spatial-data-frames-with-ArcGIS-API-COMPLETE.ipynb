    "### The ArcGIS Python API vs GeoPandas\n",
    "In ***Spatial Dataframes 1a*** we focused on reading data in to spatial dataframes using the **GeoPandas** package. Here we exlore an alternative: the **ArcGIS API for Python**. Why are there two packages? What's the difference? \n",
    "\n",
    "Both packages are built on-top of Pandas dataframes and include all the functionality of the Pandas package in dealing with spatial dataframes as standard dataframes. Both introduce geometries as a new data type, and by attaching these geometries to dataframes, enable various types of spatial analyses with our dataframes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference seems to be from where they originated and how they evolved. GeoPandas is built off of the Shapely library for dealing with geometric objects and the Fiona library for reading and writing different recognized spatial data formats. And deeper down, Geopandas uses the open source GDAL (geospatial data abstraction library) as the computation engine that drives spatial analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ArcGIS API for Python, in contrast, originated as a cloud based version of ESRI's ArcPy package. ESRI has long been developing cyberinfrastructure for web-based access to and processing of spatial data, and they have developed a host of Java based instructions for doing this. Recognizing the popularity of Python, however, ESRI has more recently developed the ArcGIS API for Python as an alternative to working with on-line spatial data. And included in this Python based offering is ESRI's own version of the spatial dataframe, what they call the \"***spatially enabled dataframe***\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line is that these two Python objects - GeoPandas' geodataframe and ESRI's spatially enabled dataframe - are quite similar, but have some key differences. They also evolve at different paces. Which one should you use? That depends on what you are doing, as each as its own advantages and limitations. The best thing to do is find a level of comfort with each and see how they compare across different tasks..."

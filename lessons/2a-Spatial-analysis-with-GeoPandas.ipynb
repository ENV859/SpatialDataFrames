    "In this notebook, we examine how GeoPandas is used in peforming a spatial analysis. We take an example of looking at the demographic characteristics of where electric vehicle (EV) charging stations have been located in Durham, Wake, and Orange counties with respect to 2010 Census and Social Vulnerability Index values. (It's not a very sensible analysis as done here, but we are concentrating on the mechanics more than the utility of the analysis...)"
